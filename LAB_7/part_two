What does this Vue error message mean? What causes it, and how do you fix it?

The "Property or method "total" is not defined on the instance but is referenced during render"
error means the total variable is being used but is not defined in the Vue objects data, to
fix the issue, the total variable must be defined within the Vue object data. Since the total
needs to changed based off the unitPrice and Qty it cant be defined directly in the Vue data,
for this scenario we can use the computed property calculates data in the Vue object and recalculates
if the data changes.
